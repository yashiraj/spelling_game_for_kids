# Beginning Spelling Game For Elementary School Students

## First Iteration 

The first iteration of this spelling game will focus on Pre-K and Kindergarten children who are learning and solidifying letter sounds.

# Goals

Three goals underlie the development of this first iteration spelling game. 

The first goal of this first iteration spelling game is to create a game that enables me to demonstrate an ability to maipulate the DOM. Being comfortable with DOM manipulation is very important to me, as I do feel an inability to bascially manipulate the DOM successfully---accessing elements, caching query results in variables, accessing content, creating event handlers that listen for an event and trigger when the event occurs--- will ultimately hinder my progress in becoming an excellent developer. 

The second goal of this first iteration spelling game is to get more comfortable with using functions and, well, the this keyword. I have long needed an approachable project where I can create functions (and the this keyword) with unabashed determination, and this project is the chance to have that breakthrough (after many failed attempts both in bootcamp and in many unfinished/abandoned projects since). It's high time to break that cycle. 

The third goal of this first iteration spelling game is to develop proficiency with creating a responsive application. Getting more familiar with flexbox and css is a huge goal for me, since, again, I believe weak foundations will undermine my progression as a growing developer. I know there are libraries (React) and frameworks out there I can use, but I'm intentionally not using them in this first iteration.
